# Lift4Today Capstone 💻 🏋️‍♀️ 💪
Lift4Today is a lifestyle brand, founded by Julie Vogel, a mom and personal trainer, and Rachel Saunders, also a mom, trainer, and , that focuses on giving their users information on how to start and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Their logo shows the name ‘Lift4Today’ encompassed by four circles that represent the four pillars they promote in order of importance. The most important being lifestyle followed by, stress management, weight lifting, and cardio in order. The clients support their users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by focusing on personal training and nutrition programs. While they have a robust website already built, they are unhappy with its appearance and also want to create a larger presence on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.

The objective of this project was for the Lift4Today project team to transform their website and social media. Lift4Today wanted to change their website to be more aesthetically pleasing by lightening up the colors and potentially focusing the theme around the colors of their logo. As we completed tasks throughout the semester, we decided not to work on adding paid content but instead to focus on the design and functionality of the website. Our clients themselves also wanted training on how to use social media because they do not consider themselves well versed. We decided not to work on growing the followings on the social media platforms but instead to focus on how to create content and how to post it. Once our live training social media meeting finished, they should be able to streamline the posts between their social media and website in order to drive traffic specifically to the website.
